# Rubiks Lab

**Rubiks Lab** is an interactive **Rubik’s Cube playground** for experimenting with cube states, rotations, and solving logic.  
It’s designed as a space to **explore**, **break**, and **understand** how a Rubik’s Cube works under the hood.

Think of it as a lab - not just a simulator.

Still under development!
